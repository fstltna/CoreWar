<H1>MY FIRST COREWAR BOOK<BR>by Steven Morrell</H1></CENTER>
<HR>

<CENTER>
<H2>PREFACE</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
This book is an introductory collection of corewar warriors with commentary. It 
assumes an acquaintance with the ICWS '88 redcode language (See M.Durham's <A 
href="ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/corewar/documents/tutorial.1.Z">tutorial.1</A> 
and <A 
href="ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/corewar/documents/tutorial.2.Z">tutorial.2</A> 
for details). Unless otherwise noted, all redcode is written in ICWS '88 and is 
designed for a coresize of 8000, process limit 8000. All documents referred to 
in this text are available by anonymous FTP at <A 
href="ftp:ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/corewar/documents/">ftp.csua.berkeley.edu</A> 
in one of the subdirectories of pub/corewar/. 
<P>After a brief introduction, each chapter presents warriors by subject. I then 
pontificate on the merits of these various warriors and give some hints for 
successful implementation. I mention credits and give references to other 
warriors worth further investigation. Unless otherwise indicated, these warriors 
are archived in <A 
href="ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/corewar/redcode/warrior10.tar.Z">warrior10.tar</A> 
in the redcode/ directory. 
<P>The presentation of each warrior follows roughly the same format. First, the 
parameters of the warrior are given. These include the name, author, attack 
speed, effective size, durability, and effectiveness, and score against the <A 
href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~pizza/koth/">Pizza Hill</A>. The effective 
size is the size of the executing code during the attack phase, taking into 
account regenerative code. Next, self-contained source code is given, followed 
by a brief description of the warrior. Finally, a detailed technical description 
of how the warrior runs is given. 
<P>I hope that this helps. If you have questions or comments, send them to <A 
href="mailto:morrell@math.utah.edu">morrell@math.utah.edu</A>, where you can 
reach me until June,1994.

<H3>Chapter 1: Imp-Rings</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
On October 14, 1992, A.Ivner posted a warrior that revolutionized the game of 
corewar. "The IMPire strikes back" scored about 170 on the Intel hill and only 
suffered 10% losses, putting it firmly in first place. A.Ivner had invented a 
way to kill other programs with imps -- the world's first imp-ring. D.Nabutovsky 
improved the launch code a bit by making an imp-spiral and adding a stone in his 
"Impressive", which lost only 2% and scored 195 when it started on the hill (for 
more information on stones, see <A 
href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~pizza/koth/chapter2.html">chapter 2</A>). 
Since that time, most warriors on the hill have either been imps or something 
hostile to imps. 
<P>This chapter deals with imps, from the basic imp proposed by A.K.Dewdney in 
the original Scientific American articles to the modern-day imp-spiral we see as 
a component of many successful warriors.

self-destructs. We shall be using this program for fodder.

<H4>--2--</H4><PRE>Name:           Imp
Author:         A.K.Dewdney

Size:           1
Durability:     Strong
Effectiveness:  Poor
Score:

imp MOV imp, imp+1
end imp</PRE>Imp presents the enemy with a small, moving target that will not 
die without a direct hit. It ties a lot, and is vulnerable to the imp-gate. (<A 
href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~pizza/koth/chapter1.html#impgate">See 
program 3</A>) 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: When Imp is loaded and before it executes, it looks like this: <PRE>MOV 0,1  (1)</PRE>(The (1) shows which instruction will execute on the 
first cycle.) When process (1) executes, it first copies its instruction to the 
next address and then moves to the next instruction: <PRE>MOV 0,1       ;This is the original.
MOV 0,1  (2)  ;This is the copy.</PRE>Process (2) now executes. Since all 
addressing is relative, the process copies its instruction to the next address 
and advances. <PRE>MOV 0,1
MOV 0,1
MOV 0,1  (3)  ;This is the second copy.</PRE>And so it goes, overwriting 
anything in its path with MOV 0,1 instructions. So when it encounters enemy 
code, it replaces the enemy code with MOV 0,1 instructions, turning the enemy 
processes into imps. Note that although the enemy code is gone, the enemy 
processes live on, so imps do not win unless the enemy code self-destructs.

Durability:     Strong
Effectiveness:  Excellent against imps, Extremely Poor against others
Score:

gate equ wait-10
wait JMP wait,&lt;gate
end wait</PRE>Imp Gate waits and destroys imps that happen to pass 10 
instructions before it. It is seldom overrun by imps and its small size makes it 
difficult to locate. The imp gate is defensive by nature, and will not win 
against a stationary enemy unless this enemy self-destructs. 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: The process running at _wait_ jumps to the A-value of this 
command, i.e. back to _wait_. However, it also decrements the B-field of _gate_. 
Thus, the B-field of _gate_ is decremented every turn. When an enemy imp comes 
by this is what happens: <PRE>MOV 0,1   (x)  ;here comes the imp
DAT 0,-5       ;here is the gate

The imp copies itself and advances onto the gate:

MOV 0,1
MOV 0,1   (x+1)  ;here is the gate</PRE>The gate decrements: <PRE>MOV 0,1
MOV 0,0   (x+1)  ;here is the gate</PRE>The imp copies this instruction to 
itself (effectively doing nothing) and advances, falling off the end: <PRE>MOV 0,1
MOV 0,0        ;here is the gate
          (x+2)</PRE>The gate decrements again (but the damage has already been 
done.) <PRE>MOV 0,1
MOV 0,-1       ;here is the gate
          (x+2)</PRE>The enemy process executes an illegal instruction and dies.

end launch</PRE>Worm is a symbiotic collection of imps. The only vulnerable 
parts of the worm is the tail instruction and the instruction about to execute, 
hence the effective size of 1.75 (25% of the time, the tail instruction is the 
instruction about to execute.) It is very difficult to kill, because each imp 
must be disposed of individually. However, it is still vulnerable to imp gates. 
As with Imp, Worm overwrites enemy code but preserves enemy processes. 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: First, we launch the worm using a binary launch: <PRE>SPL 4,0  (1)

end launch</PRE>Ring is a symbiotic collection of three imps distributed through 
core. It has the capability to destroy enemy processes it overruns, if the enemy 
is running only one or two processes. This code will run correctly only in a 
coresize of 8000, although the constants may be tweaked to run in any coresize 
not divisible by 3. Ring is an example of a 3-pt imp. 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: The launching code is a very small binary startup: <PRE>JMP -2663,   0
SPL     0,   0  (1)
SPL  2668,   0
MOV     0,2667</PRE>The first process splits: <PRE>JMP -2663,   0  (3)

SPL  2668,   0  (2)
MOV     0,2667</PRE>The second process splits: <PRE>JMP -2663,   0  (3)
SPL     0,   0

third process jumps: <PRE>MOV 0,2667  (4)

            (5)  ;this location is 2667 instructions after the imp
...
            (6)  ;this location is 2667 instructions after process (2)</PRE>Now 
the fun begins. Process (4) executes, copying the imp instruction to process (5) 
and becoming process (7): <PRE>MOV 0,2667
            (7)
...
MOV 0,2667  (5)
...
            (6)</PRE>(5) executes, copying the imp instruction to process (6): <PRE>MOV 0,2667
            (7)
...
MOV 0,2667
            (8)
...
MOV 0,2667  (6)</PRE>And now (6) executes, copying the imp instruction back to 
process (7): <PRE>MOV 0,2667
MOV 0,2667  (7)
...
MOV 0,2667
            (8)
...
MOV 0,2667
            (9)</PRE>The cycle starts all over again, and the ring creeps 
forward. 
<P>Let's see what happens when Ring fights Wait (Program 1). Wait executes JMP 
0,0 until eventually Ring overwrites this instruction with MOV 0,2667. <PRE>MOV 0,2667  (1)</PRE>Wait executes this instruction and advances: <PRE>MOV 0,2667
            (2)</PRE>Since Ring takes 3 cycles to move the next command into 
place, Wait's process now executes an illegal instruction and dies. 
<P>So Ring slowly advances through core, and if the enemy is running a single 
process, it falls off the end of the imp ring.

end launch</PRE>Spiral crosses the durability of a worm with the effectiveness 
of a ring. Spiral is resistant to most conventional attacks, and since it is an 
8-process imp-ring, it kills any enemy it overwrites if the enemy has less than 
8 processes running. The only vulnerable parts of the spiral are the tail and 
the process that is currently running. Spiral is vulnerable to imp gates, 
however. 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: After a binary launch, the processes are arranged as follows: <PRE>MOV 0,2667  (16)
            (19) ;this process is 2667 instructions after process (18)
            (22)
...
            (17) ;this process is 2667 instructions after process (16)
            (20)
            (23)
...
            (18) ;this process is 2667 instructions after process (17)
            (21)</PRE>Now the spiral worms along: (16) copies the imp to (17), 
which copies it to (18), and so on. All the processes advance 1 instruction as 
this happens, and then the imp-passing instructions begin again. 
<P>A step-by step analysis of how imp gates destroy spirals would be lengthy and 
unnecessarily complicated. The key idea is this: The imp gate is constantly 
being modified. As the imp overruns the imp gate, no imp instructions are left 
intact to copy to the next processes' location. This next process executes an 
illegal instruction and dies. This scenario repeats until the entire spiral 
moves through the imp gate and disintegrates.

end start</PRE>Gate Crashing Spiral is a collection of three spirals that work 
together to kill imp gates. The first is a standard imp spiral and the other two 
are slightly modified, interleaved for greater protection against split bombs. 
The large size of its launch code makes it vulnerable to fast attacks. 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: Each spiral has its own binary launch. The first spiral 
launches first and crawls forward an instruction by the time the other two 
spirals have launched. Core then looks like this (after resetting the counter 
for clearer exposition): <PRE>MOV 0,2667       ;This is label imp1 | MOV 0,2667       | MOV 0,2667

move forward via the usual instruction juggling. 
<P>When a gate crashing spiral overruns a gate, the second or third spirals hit 
first: <PRE>MOV 0,2668  (x) ;imp gate here</PRE>The gate decrements: <PRE>MOV 0,2667  (x)</PRE>The wounded spiral copies this instruction 2667 ahead: 
<PRE>MOV 0,2667
            (x+24)
...
MOV 0,2667</PRE>The second and third spirals now fall off the end and die, and 
then the first spiral hits the gate: <PRE>MOV 0,2667  (y) ;imp gate here
...
MOV 0,2667  (y+1)</PRE>The gate decrements: <PRE>MOV 0,2666  (y)
...
MOV 0,2667  (y+1)</PRE>Process (y) executes, and can't copy the imp to process 
(y+1), but this is okay, because process (y+1) executes the imp instruction from 
the two spirals gone before. The spiral crawls through the gate and goes on to 
kill the enemy processes.

end launch</PRE>Nimbus Spiral launches a 63-point spiral with two processes per 
point. Because a binary launch would exceed the 100-instruction limit, Nimbus 
Spiral uses what is called a Nimbus-type launch. The code for this type of 
launch is obviously smaller, but the time it takes to launch spirals is roughly 
doubled. 
<P>HOW IT WORKS: Each SPL 1 command doubles the number of processes acting in 
tandem at the next instruction. The first process that executes the MOV -1,0 
command does not split, but all subsequent processes execute a SPL 1 command. 
Hence, before execution of the SPL 2 command, core looks like this (with counter 
reset): <PRE>MOV 0,127
SPL 1,0
SPL 1,0
SPL 1,0
SPL 1,0
SPL 1,0

ADD #127,-1  Even processes</PRE>We reset the processes again. Process (1) now 
executes, jumping to the location of the B-operand of the JMP instruction: <PRE>MOV 0,127    (253)   ;this came from process (1)

             (254)                   ;this came from process (2)</PRE>And it 
continues. Process (3) jumps to a new location. The even processes modify the 
jump vector, and the odd processes do all of the jumping. By the time process 
(127) is ready to execute, we have the following situation: <PRE>MOV 0,127    (253)
SPL 1,0      (379)
SPL 1,0

             Even processes
...
Odd processes broadcast throughout core</PRE>The odd processes form an imp 
spiral and the even processes execute illegal instructions and die, leaving just 
the spiral to crawl through memory.

Two questions beg to be answered: When should you add an imp to your favorite 
warrior, and how do you kill imps? 
<P>Most of today's fighters have some resistance to imps, so pure imp programs 
seldom are successful. But imps are easy to add to code that has multiple 
processes running, like today's stones, vampires, or paper. The most successful 
imp warriors use most of their process time in a more conventional attack, and 
rely on the imp-ring as a backup. Whether an imp is a good idea in your program 
depends on the program; you may lose less, but you may win less. About the only 
thing you can be sure of is tying more. But testing your warrior always helps. 
<P>Killing imps is difficult, but not impossible. Imp gates work well against 
most imps, but should only be executed after the rest of your code has done its 
stuff. Imp gates of the form <PRE>         SPL 0,&lt;gate
         DAT &lt;gate,&lt;gate</PRE>can sometimes kill even gate-crashing imps. 
Fast bombing programs can occasionally catch the launching code before it has 
completed, especially with fancier imps. Code with a long enough bombing run 
(e.g. Charon v8.1) can hit and destroy all the imp instructions if it is done 
right. Dropping a single MOV 0,&lt;1 bomb on the tail (or vulnerable instruction 
soon after the tail) of an imp-ring will kill the entire ring off. Dropping a 
MOV &lt;2667,&lt;5334 instruction on a 3-point imp ring can kill as many as 9 
imp instructions, and is extremely effective in a stream (which is sequential 
bombing of memory). Some programs use an imp trap tailor-made for stunning 
imp-rings by dropping SPL 0 bombs on the imp-ring using a step size of 2667, so 
that the ring is attacked from the tail forward. 
<P>An enhancement to the imp-launching routines is to add decrement statements 
to all the b-fields of the SPL and JMP commands. If you have a large binary 
launch, for example, you could decrement 63 instructions throughout core for 
free. Most of the original code I have based this chapter on has such b-fields. 
<P>Here is a list of imp-style programs worth investigating. Unless otherwise 
noted, they can be found in <A 
href="ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/corewar/redcode/warrior10.tar.Z">warrior10.tar</A> 
in the 88 directory. Imp-stone combos will be listed in the back of <A

Program 2, Imp, was written by A.K. Dewdney for his Scientific American 
articles. 
<P>Program 3, Imp Gate, was suggested in its current form by B.Thomsen, and is 
often called a wimp in the literature. 
<P>Program 5, Ring, was stolen and modified from a _Push Off_ article from 
P.Kline, but it looks suspiciously like A.Ivner's "Trident." 
<P>Program 7, Gate Crashing Spiral, was stolen and modified from P.Kline's 
"Cannonade." 
<P>Program 8, Nimbus Spiral, was stolen and modified from A.MacAulay's "Nimbus 
1.2."
