I. Preface - Reader Beware!

   The name "Core War" arguably can be claimed as public domain.
Thus, any program can pass itself off as an implementation of Core
War.  Ideally, one would like to write a Redcode program on one system
and know that it will run in exactly the same manner on every other
system.  Alas, this is not the case.
   Basically, Core War systems fall under one of four catagories:
Non-ICWS, ICWS'86, ICWS'88, or Extended.  Non-ICWS systems are usually
a variant of Core War as described by A. K. Dewdney in his "Computer
Recreations" articles appearing in Scientific American.  ICWS'86 and
ICWS'88 systems conform to the standards set out by the International
Core War Society in their standards of 1986 and 1988, respectively.
Extended systems generally support ICWS'86, ICWS'88, and proprietary
extensions to those standards.  I will discuss frequently common
extensions as if they were available on all Extended systems (which
they most certainly are not).
   I will not describe Non-ICWS systems in this article.  Most Non-
ICWS systems will be easily understood if you understand the systems
described in this article however.  Although called "standards",
ICWS'86 and ICWS'88 (to a lesser extent) both suffer from ambiguities
and extra-standard issues which I will try to address.
   This is where the reader should beware.  Because almost any
interpretation of the standard(s) is as valid as any other, I
naturally prefer MY interpretation.  I will try to point out other
common interpretations when ambiguities arise though, and I will
clearly indicate what is interpretation (mine or otherwise) as such.
You have been warned!

II. Notation

   "86:" will indicate an ICWS'86 feature.  "88:" will indicate an
ICWS'88 feature.  "X:" will indicate an Extended feature.  "Durham:"
will indicate my biased interpretation.  "Other:" will indicate
interpretations adhered to by others.  "Commentary:" is me explaining
what I am doing and why.  "Editorial:" is me railing for or against
certain usages.  Items without colon-suffixed prefaces can be
considered universal.

   Redcode consists of assembly language instructions of the form

&lt;label&gt;   &lt;opcode&gt; &lt;A-mode&gt;&lt;A-field&gt;, &lt;B-mode&gt;&lt;B-field&gt;   &lt;comment&gt;

An example Recode program:

; Imp
; by A. K. Dewdney
;
imp     MOV imp, imp+1      ; This program copies itself ahead one
        END                 ; instruction and moves through memory.


The &lt;label&gt; is optional.
86: &lt;label&gt; begins in the first column, is one to eight characters
    long, beginning with an alphabetic character and consisting
    entirely of alphanumerals.  Case is ignored ("abc" is equivalent
    to "ABC").
88: &lt;label&gt; as above, except length is not limited and case is not
    addressed.  Only the first eight characters are considered
    significant.
X: &lt;label&gt; can be preceded by any amount of whitespace (spaces, tabs,
    and newlines), consists of any number of significant alphanumerals
    but must start with an alphabetic, and case is significant ("abc"
    is different from "ABC").
Commentary: I will always use lowercase letters for labels to
    distinguish labels from opcodes and family operands.

The &lt;opcode&gt; is separated from the &lt;label&gt; (if there is one) by
    whitespace.  Opcodes may be entered in either uppercase or
    lowercase.  The case does not alter the instruction.  DAT, MOV,
    ADD, SUB, JMP, JMZ, JMN, DJN, CMP, SPL, and END are acceptable
    opcodes.
86: SPACE is also recognized as an opcode.
88: SLT and EQU are recognized as opcodes.  SPACE is not.
X: All of the above are recognized as opcodes as well as XCH and PCT,
    plus countless other extensions.
Commentary: END, SPACE, and EQU are known as pseudo-ops because they
    really indicate instructions to the assembler and do not produce
    executable code.  I will always capitalize opcodes and pseudo-ops
    to distinguish them from labels and text.

The &lt;A-mode&gt; and &lt;A-field&gt; taken together are referred to as the
    A-operand.  Similarly, the &lt;B-mode&gt;&lt;B-field&gt; combination is known
    as the B-operand.  The A-operand is optional for some opcodes.
    The B-operand is optional for some opcodes.  Only END can go
    without at least one operand.
86: Operands are separated by a comma.
88: Operands are separated by whitespace.
X: Operands are separated by whitespace and/or a comma.  Lack of a
    comma can lead to unexpected behaviour for ambiguous constructs.
Commentary: The '88 standard forces you to write an operand without
    whitespace, reserving whitespace to separate the operands.  I like
    whitespace in my expressions, therefore I prefer to separate my
    operands with a comma and will do so here for clarity.

&lt;mode&gt; is # (Immediate Addressing), @ (Indirect Addressing), or &lt;
    (86: Auto-Decrement Indirect, 88: Pre-Decrement Indirect).  A
    missing mode indicates Direct Addressing.
86: $ is an acceptable mode, also indicating Direct Addressing.
88: $ is not an acceptable mode.
X: $ is an acceptable mode as in 86:.
Commentary: The distinction between Auto-Decrement Indirect Addressing
    and Pre-Decrement Indirect Addressing is semantic, not syntactic.

&lt;field&gt; is any combination of labels and integers separated by the
    arithmetic operators + (addition) and - (subtraction).
86: Parentheses are explicitly forbidden.  "*" is defined as a special
    label symbol meaning the current statement.
88: Arithmetic operators * (multiplication) and / (integer division)
    are added.  "*" is NOT allowed as a special label as in 86:.
X: Parentheses and whitespace are permitted in expressions.
Commentary: The use of "*" as meaning the current statement may be
    useful in some real assemblers, but is completely superfluous in a
    Redcode assembler.  The current statement can always be referred
    to as 0 in Redcode.

&lt;comment&gt; begins with a ; (semicolon), ends with a newline, and can
    have any number of intervening characters.  A comment may appear
    on a line by itself with no instruction preceding it.
88: Blank lines are explicitly allowed.


   I will often use "A" to mean any A-operand and "B" to mean any
B-operand (capitalization is important).  I use "a" to mean any  A-
field and "b" to mean any B-field.  For this reason, I never use "a"
or "b" as an actual label.
   I enclose sets of operands or instructions in curly braces.  Thus
"A" is equivalent to "{ a, #a, @a, &lt;a }". I use "???" to mean any
opcode and "x" or "label" as an arbitrary label.  Thus, the complete
family of acceptable Redcode statements can be represented as

x    ??? A, B   ; This represents all possible Redcode statements.

"???" is rarely used as most often we wish to discuss the behaviour of
a specific opcode.  I will often use labels such as "x-1" (despite its
illegality) for the instruction before the instruction labelled "x",
for the logically obvious reason.  "M" always stands for the integer
with the same value as the MARS memory size.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


III. MARS Peculiarities

   There are two things about MARS which make Redcode different from
any other assembly language.  The first of these is that there are no
absolute addresses in MARS.  The second is that memory is circular.
   Because there are no absolute addresses, all Redcode is written
using relative addressing.  In relative addressing, all addresses are
interpreted as offsets from the currently executing instruction.
Address 0 is the currently executing instruction.  Address -1 was the
previously executed instruction (assuming no jumps or branches).
Address +1 is the next instruction to execute (again assuming no jumps
or branches).
   Because memory is circular, each instruction has an infinite number
of addresses.  Assuming a memory size of M, the current instruction
has the addresses { ..., -2M, -M, 0, M, 2M, ... }.  The previous
instruction is { ..., -1-2M, -1-M, -1, M-1, 2M-1, ... }.  The next
instruction is { ..., 1-2M, 1-M, 1, M+1, 2M+1, ... }.

Commentary: MARS systems have historically been made to operate on
   object code which takes advantage of this circularity by insisting
   that fields be normalized to positive integers between 0 and M-1,
   inclusive.  Since memory size is often not known at the time of
   assembly, a loader in the MARS system (which does know the memory
   size) takes care of field normalization in addition to its normal
   operations of code placement and task pointer initialization.

Commentary: Redcode programmers often want to know what the memory
    size of the MARS is ahead of time.  This is not always possible.
    Since normalized fields can only represent integers between 0 and
    M-1 inclusive, we can not represent M in a normalized field.  The
    next best thing?  M-1.  But how can we write M-1 when we do not
    know the memory size?  Recall from above that -1 is equivalent to
    M-1.  Final word of caution: -1/2 is assembled as 0 (not as M/2)
    since the expression is evaluated within the assembler as -0.5 and
    then truncated.

86: Only two assembled-Redcode programs (warriors) are loaded into
    MARS memory (core).
88: Core is initialized to (filled with) DAT 0, 0 before loading any
    warriors.  Any number of warriors may be loaded into core.

Commentary: Tournaments almost always pit warrior versus warrior with
    only two warriors in core.

   MARS is a multi-tasking system.  Warriors start as just one task,
but can "split" off additional tasks.  When all of a warriors tasks
have been killed, the warrior is declared dead.  When there is a sole
warrior still executing in core, that warrior is declared the winner.
86: Tasks are limited to a maximum of 64 for each warrior.
88: The task limit is not set by the standard.
